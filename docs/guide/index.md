# Guide
The Official Guide For Pycord

## Before you begin...
Pycord has a lot of features which would be too advanced for a person just starting out with python,
We would suggest you get the basic knowledge of Python before starting there is a lot of tutorials to follow and we would suggest you start off with small projects then get bigger as you progress.

### How much python do i need to know?

- The difference between instances and class attributes.
    - e.g. `guild.name` vs `discord.Guild.name` or any variation of these.
- How to use data structures in the language.
    - `dict`/`tuple`/`list`/`str`/`...`
- How to solve `NameError` or `SyntaxError` exceptions.
- How to read and understand tracebacks.

This list **doesn't** fully cover everything you should know before using Pycord, We would suggest you atleast know these before atempting to make a bot in Pycord.
